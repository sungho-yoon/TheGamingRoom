# The Gaming Room Software Design Document


The purpose of theis software is to design a web-based game application "Draw It or Lose It". This game is designed by client The Gaming Room. This game renders image from a large library of stock drawings, and teams will compete to guess what is being drawn. The clident needs to deveop web-based version of the gaming app to support various devices to access the game. The UML Diagram that was designed to support this software shows how each classes are designed and interact with each other to support various features. The overall process of designing this diagram helped me to understand how a software is deisgned before writing actual codes.

If I was to revies the document, I want to study more storage managment and memory management feature. In current document, this seems vague. It does not cover how memory management can be supported for this software. I want to study more on how to apply memory managment to the software to enhance allocation and deallocation.

To design this software, i set up the bigger picture first. In beginning, I started with "how should this software work?". This software requires different classes such as players, game, team, game service, and singleton tester to enable unique instance. After that, I built up UML diagram of each class, specifying its pubilc and private classes. Once all classes were identified, I added relationship between clases. This process helped me to understand how I can add structures to different clasees by relating them.
